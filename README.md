# Music_Player_HTML_CSS
Created with CodeSandbox

Hey everyone
In my journey to learn coding, this is my first major project which is a non working music player and it containes purely HTML and CSS and it was build with the thought of keeping in mind of what entities does a music player containes.

What it includes?
- A progress bar at the bottom of the screen where play/pause/forward/backward icons have been given and it is a flex-box.
- Navbar is also a flex containing logo with a rotating transition, favourites link and a search bar.
- In the middle there is content which contains different sections with their transitions.

Source Code is in the index.html file and styles.css is the CSS file.
